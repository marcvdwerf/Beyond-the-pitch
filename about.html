      <p style="font-size: 0.95rem; line-height: 1.7; color: #E5EAF0;">
        I’m Marc, the founder of Beyond the Pitch. Born and based in the Netherlands, I’ve built my career in tourism, working on global projects for some of the world’s largest airlines and leading international ground‑transportation initiatives across the world. Along the way, I discovered something meaningful: sport is far more than entertainment — it’s a universal language that connects people, cultures, and communities.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 0.95rem; line-height: 1.7; color: #E5EAF0;">
        With a degree in Sports Marketing and a lifelong passion for exploring new cultures through food, language, and local experiences, I felt inspired to create a platform that brings all these elements together. That idea grew into Beyond the Pitch.

      <p style="font-size: 0.95rem; line-height: 1.7; color: #E5EAF0;">
        My name is Martijn, and football has been at the center of my life for as long as I can remember. I played professionally for around ten years, starting in the academy of PSV Eindhoven and later continuing my career across several first‑ and second‑division clubs in the Netherlands. Today, I’m still active at the third level of Dutch football.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 0.95rem; line-height: 1.7; color: #E5EAF0;">
        After stepping away from the highest professional level, I felt a strong desire to share what football has given me: the energy of performing for a crowd, the joy of entertaining people, and the unique connection that sport creates between players and fans. Combined with my passion for discovering new cultures, Beyond the Pitch gives me the perfect opportunity to bring these worlds together.
